# WINNING SPACE RACE WITH DATA SCIENCE 
This is capstone project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The project involves data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting results to stakeholders.

The overall goal is to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. 

With the data gathered during this project, the competing startup can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## General Information
In recent years we are witnessing the rapidly decreasing cost of launching objects into orbit. 

NASA’s space shuttles, which were retired in 2011, costed an average of $1.6 billion per flight, or nearly $30,000 per pound of payload (in 2021 dollars) to reach low-Earth orbit, according to an analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 

Russia’s Soyuz rockets can cost anywhere from $53 million to $225 million per launch, working out to more than $8,000 per pound of payload to reach Earth orbit, while Chinese Long March 3B cost around US$50-70 million per launch. 

Today however, commercial companies like SpaceX and Rocket Lab created a competitive market that drove down the price of rides to space. 

Rocket Lab, an aerospace company from California, debuted its Electron rocket in 2018. The company provides launches to Earth orbit for small satellites, which range from CubeSats roughly the size of a loaf of bread to minifridge-sized spacecraft that weigh less than 1,100 pounds. Rocket Lab charges around $5 million per flight, a cost that works out to roughly $10,000 per pound of payload. 

SpaceX offers even more competitive pricing for rides aboard its medium-lift Falcon 9 rocket. The company typically charges around $67 million per launch, or around $1,200 per pound of payload to reach low-Earth orbit, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

In this analysis, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully based on some underlaying conditions, such as payload mass, launch site, destination orbit, booster version, etc. this way we can determine the cost of a launch. That information can be later used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
